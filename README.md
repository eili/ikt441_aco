• A backpacker should travel from a (1) Start city to a (2)
Destination city, (3) visiting at least N number of cities.
Which cities are not important.
• Example: Travel from (1) no,oslo, to (2) no,bergen, (3)
Visiting at least 10 cities on his way.
• Use the (any variant of ACO) to find the shortest path with
the above criteria.
• Assumptions: The distance between two cities is the air
distance.

• Hints:
• Remove duplicate cities.
• Reduce the map to make the problem easier in the testing
phase, e.g. only Norway.
• Reduce the problem if needed.
• Make necesarry assumptions to solve the task.
• How many cities can you support?
